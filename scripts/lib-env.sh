# Shared configuration resolution for backup.sh and restore.sh.
#
# The application fills its configuration from three layers (src/config/load-env.ts), each supplying
# only what the previous one left unset:
#
#   1. the process environment
#   2. ./.env
#   3. <data dir>/.env.generated   — written by Dashboard > Infrastructure
#
# These scripts used to read layer 1 only, so an install configured through the dashboard was backed
# up at the DEFAULT paths. That is not reliably loud: a missing database fails the run, but a
# database left at a default path from BEFORE the operator switched is archived instead, and the run
# exits 0. A backup that captured an abandoned database only reveals itself during a restore.
#
# Deliberately conservative: only a plain `KEY=value` line is honoured. Blanks around the `=` and the
# value, and CRLF line endings, are tolerated as dotenv tolerates them. A value carrying quotes or a
# `#`, and a `KEY: value` line, are reported and skipped rather than guessed at, because a silently
# mis-parsed path is the exact failure this exists to prevent. Nothing here exports anything: each
# key is looked up by name, so a stray entry in an operator's .env can never reach the script's own
# environment.
