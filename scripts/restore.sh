# OpenWA restore.
#
# Restores the always-SQLite auth/audit database, a SQLite data store, engine authentication, local
# media, installed plugins, and bootstrap configuration from an archive produced by scripts/backup.sh.
# PostgreSQL dumps are staged for the explicit psql import printed at the end of the restore.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/restore.sh <backup-archive.tar.gz> [--strict] [--force]
# Options:
#   --strict          refuse to restore an archive whose CONSISTENCY-WARNING marker reports
#                     plain-copied (possibly torn) database snapshots; without it the restore
#                     continues after a loud warning
#   --force           overwrite databases that already hold a working install's data; without it
#                     the restore refuses to touch a live target before changing anything
# Environment:
#   MAIN_DATABASE_NAME  restore target for the auth/audit DB (default: ./data/main.sqlite)
#   DATABASE_NAME       restore target for the SQLite data store (default: ./data/openwa.sqlite)
#                       Both resolve EXACTLY like the app: the environment first, then ./.env, then
#                       .env.generated (the archive's copy when it carries one, else the data dir's),
#                       otherwise the fixed ./data default (see lib-env.sh). They are NOT derived
#                       from OPENWA_DATA_DIR; restoring there would write databases the app never
#                       reads (fresh-empty boot + new master key).
#   OPENWA_DATA_DIR   data directory to restore non-DB state into (default: ./data)
#   SESSION_DATA_PATH, BAILEYS_AUTH_DIR, STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH, PLUGINS_DIR
#                     override the corresponding state directories
#   PLUGIN_STATE_DIR  root whose plugins/ holds the plugin registry and ctx.storage (default: the
#                     data dir)
#   BOOTSTRAP_KEY_FILE  where the plaintext admin key goes (default: <data dir>/.api-key)
#                     These paths resolve through the same layers as the databases.
#   OPENWA_RESTORE_SNAPSHOT_DIR
#                     where the safety snapshots go (default: next to the data dir, and next to
#                     each target outside it); needed when a parent is read-only, as in the
#                     shipped container
#
# Stop the OpenWA app before restoring. A snapshot of the current data dir, and of every target
# outside it, is taken before anything is written so a bad restore can be undone.
#
