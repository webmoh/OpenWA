/**
 * One-time rename of the engine auth directories from the legacy `Session.name` key to `Session.id`.
 *
 * Runs in `onModuleInit`, which Nest completes for EVERY module before the first
 * `onApplicationBootstrap` hook: auto-start launches engines from that later hook and the HTTP
 * listener binds later still, so no engine can have opened a directory while this runs.
 *
 * Safety properties, in the order they matter:
 *
 * - It only ever RENAMES. A legacy directory is never deleted, so a run that fails halfway (or a
 *   second node racing this one) can lose nothing: `rename` is atomic within a filesystem, so each
 *   directory is either at its old path or its whole self at the new one, and the loser of a race
 *   gets ENOENT and logs.
 * - It is idempotent. After a successful run the legacy entry is gone, so the next boot matches
 *   nothing. A directory already at the id key is left alone.
 * - It matches the on-disk entry name EXACTLY, from a directory listing, rather than asking
 *   `fs.existsSync` whether the legacy path exists. That is what makes it safe on the
 *   case-insensitive filesystems the bug (#1597) comes from: there, `existsSync` answers yes for
 *   `session-My-Bot` when only `session-my-bot` is stored, and the rename would hand one session's
 *   WhatsApp login to another. An exact match moves each directory to the id of the row that really
 *   owns it.
 * - A missing base directory (fresh install, or an engine never used here) is a no-op.
 *
 * Keep it beyond one release: an operator can upgrade from any older version, and the directories
 * they bring are name-keyed.
