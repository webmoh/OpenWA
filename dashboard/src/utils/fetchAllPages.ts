// walk stops instead of spending more of the budget that tier is refusing. The default `maxItems`
// stops a walk at 50 pages of 200: half the minute's budget stays for the caller's own reads of that
// route, and an hour's budget holds about 20 such walks.

/**
 * Walk an offset-paginated list endpoint to completion.
 *
 * Termination is driven by the server's own `total` and by short/empty pages — never by comparing
 * the returned page length against the *requested* size. Endpoints clamp `limit` server-side (audit
 * caps at MAX_AUDIT_PAGE_SIZE), so a `page.length < requested` test reads a clamped first page as
 * "last page" and silently truncates the result.
 *
 * `truncated` is set when the `maxItems` safety cap ended the walk while the server still had rows,
 * or when a page stayed throttled after rows were already in hand; `throttled` tells the second apart.
